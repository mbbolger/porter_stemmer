## Porter Stemming Algorithm

Implementation of the algorithm for word stemming outlined by Martin Porter in [*An algorithm for suffix stripping*](https://cl.lingfil.uu.se/~marie/undervisning/textanalys16/porter.pdf) (*M.F. Porter, 1980, Program, **14**(3) pp 130âˆ’137*)

Broadly in working order, excepting a few minor bugs to be ironed out.

Slower than the NLTK implementation at present, but in some cases more accurate.

Unit tests from the paper to be added for sanity checking.
